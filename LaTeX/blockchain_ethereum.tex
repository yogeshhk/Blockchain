\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{What is Ethereum?}
\begin{itemize}
\item Started by Vitalik Butarin in 2013.
\item Bitcoin is a crypto currency, whereas Ethereum is a platform where people can build apps on top.
\item Its a blockchain which not only allows to store transactions but also programs (Smart Contract) along.
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{What is Smart Contract?}
\begin{itemize}
\item A program having rules-code on blockchain nodes.
\item Bitcoin has a script called Bitcoin Script, whereas Ethereum has programming languages Solidity using which Smart Contracts can be programmed.
\item Bitcoin Script is not Turin-Complete, whereas Solidity is.
\item Whats Turin-Complete? meaning, you can code any logic, say, using conditionals, loops, etc. 
\item Bitcoin Script does not have loops, to avoid infinite computation possibilities.
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{So, Ethereum is}
Each node has:
\begin{itemize}
\item History of all Smart Contracts.
\item History of all Transactions.
\item Current state of all Smart Contracts.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{DApps}
Decentralized Apps
\begin{itemize}
\item Front end as app and back-end as Smart Contracts
\item Interface to interact with blockchain, an API
\item Example: Steemit (twitter on blockchain)
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{EVM}
Ethereum Virtual Machine

\begin{itemize}
\item VM running your machine, to run smart contracts.
\item It has no access to outside world on the computer. Secure.
\item Loops are added, but how to curb long computations. Got GAS!!
\item Basically payment to run computation. More computation more money (GAS). 
\item For `addition' operation, say, you need 3 units of GAS.
\item No infinite loop as you will run out of GAS.
\item As Eth as currency is volatile, can predict its price, so instead GAS is purchased first then consumed.
\end{itemize}
