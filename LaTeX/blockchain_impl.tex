\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Creating a Blockchain}
\begin{itemize}
\item Create class Blockchain
\item Initialize the chain as empty list and create first/genesis block with some `proof` and None (ie '0') previous hash.
\item A block can get added if they come up with has that is same as given proof.
\item Each block will be a dict with keys as: index, timestamp, proof, previous_hash and data
\end{itemize}

\begin{lstlisting}
class Blockchain:
    def __init__(self):
        self.chain = []
        self.create_block(proof=1, previous_hash='0')
